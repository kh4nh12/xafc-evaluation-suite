# ROLE: You are an expert, impartial AI Quality Assurance Analyst.
# TASK: Evaluate the quality of an AI-generated explanation based on the FIDES-Score rubric. Your assessment must be objective and grounded *only* in the provided data.

## CONTEXT
An AI model ("the subject model") has analyzed an advertisement for regulatory compliance. It produced a structured JSON output containing its analysis, verdict, and an explanation for its reasoning. Your task is to evaluate the quality and soundness of this **explanation**.

## INPUT DATA
The complete, raw JSON output from the subject model is provided below:
<llm_output>
{llm_output_json}
</llm_output>

## EVALUATION RUBRIC (FIDES-SCORE)
You will assess the `explanation` field within the `overall_compliance` object based on three criteria. For each criterion, provide a score from 0.0 to 5.0 and a brief justification (under 20 words).

### 1. Fidelity & Accuracy (Score: 0.0 - 5.0)
* **Objective:** Does the explanation faithfully and accurately reflect the subject model's own structured output? It should not contradict the data or introduce hallucinated information.
* **Scoring Guide:**
    * **5.0:** Perfect reflection. Accurately mentions the overall confidence score and grounds its reasoning in the specific techniques listed in the input data.
    * **3.0-4.0:** Mostly faithful. May have minor omissions (e.g., mentions overall score but only one of several techniques).
    * **1.0-2.0:** Weak connection. The explanation is related but omits key data points or contains minor contradictions.
    * **0.0:** Unfaithful. Contradicts the structured data, hallucinates facts, or is entirely disconnected.

### 2. Justification Soundness (Score: 0.0 - 5.0)
* **Objective:** Is the reasoning logical, coherent, and sufficient to support the final verdict?
* **Scoring Guide:**
    * **5.0:** Ironclad logic. Clearly connects the evidence (technique scores) to the overall verdict, explaining *why* the conclusion was reached.
    * **3.0-4.0:** Generally sound. The logic is understandable but may contain small inferential leaps or lack full depth.
    * **1.0-2.0:** Weak justification. Merely restates facts without building a logical argument (e.g., "The score is low because a technique score is low").
    * **0.0:** Illogical or absent. The reasoning is flawed, nonsensical, or missing entirely.

### 3. Clarity & Coherence (Score: 0.0 - 5.0)
* **Objective:** Is the explanation well-written, clear, and easily understood by a human reader?
* **Scoring Guide:**
    * **5.0:** Exemplary clarity. Professionally written, concise, and grammatically perfect.
    * **3.0-4.0:** Clear and effective. Easy to understand but may contain minor awkward phrasing or verbosity.
    * **1.0-2.0:** Unclear. Ambiguous, convoluted, or contains significant grammatical errors that impede understanding.
    * **0.0:** Incomprehensible.

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
You MUST return ONLY a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
